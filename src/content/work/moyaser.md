Appointment management system for dental clinics and centers that care in every detail (e.g. worktimes, vacations) with powerfull reporting and highly secure. I developed the backend in C# DotNet Core and SQL Server for the database. The frontend was developed with VueJS and ElectronJS. Currently, it is running in the busiest dental center in Damascus Syria.
